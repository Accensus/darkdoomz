# DarkDoomZ (flashlight only)
This branch consists of just the DarkDoomZ flashlight code, per request.

A settings menu is provided to adjust the effect. The following settings are available:

## Flashlight Settings
* **Quality**
  * **Simple** - Single spot light using the average spread/intensity of the fancy lights.
  * **Fancy** - Two spot lights to simulate both focused beam and light spill.
* **Type** - Preset light styles. The brighter options may negatively affect performance.
  * **Incandescent** - Dim warm bulb with a wide beam and little spill.
  * **Halogen** - Moderately bright, focused beam with large spill.
  * **LED** - Very bright focused beam, very wide shallow spill
  * **Red Filter** - Dim, nightvision-preserving light, same spread as the halogen.
* **Position** - Where the light is relative to the player and how it moves.
  * **Handheld** - Loose springy following style, from below the viewpoint.
  * **Left / Right Shoulder** - Tighter following, offset to the side of the viewpoint.
  * **Helmet** - Very tight following, above viewpoint
