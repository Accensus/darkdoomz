# darkdoomz
This simple mutator/add-on re-implements the concept behind SidDoyle's Dark Doom, using ZScript. Basically, makes Doom darker by reducing the light levels across all sectors in the map.

A settings menu is provided to adjust the preferred darkness level, including presets to mimic the three original DarkDoom levels.

Please note that sectors modified with ACS or special lighting specials may not be properly adjusted.
